# v1 — Findings (pilot run, non-blind)

Narrative reading of [REPORT.md](REPORT.md) (raw numbers). Small-n pilot
(6 tasks × 4 arms × 3 blind judges); directional, not definitive.

**Superseded in part by v2 — see the banner above.**

## 1. Identity beats relevance — decisively, and on *usefulness* not just fit

On tasks where who-you-are matters, the **psyche** arm beat the **naked**
prompt **100%** of the time and beat **relevance-retrieval (context) 93%**.
Borda: psyche **41**, best 29, context 15, naked 5.

Crucially, the lift shows up on **insight** (psyche 9.3 vs context 7.2), not
only **personal fit** (9.5 vs 7.3). The psyche answers weren't merely more
*you-flavored* — blind judges found them more genuinely *useful*. Judge
rationales cite the answers reasoning from the user's own frameworks by name
(reframing "capability ceiling" as *targeting*; catching a thesis-level
counter the user had left implicit). That is the core of the hypothesis
holding up: telling the model **who you are** raised the quality of the work,
not just its flattery.

## 2. Best-of-breed *lost* to psyche-alone — the surprise

The predicted winner — **context + psyche** — did **not** win. **Psyche alone
beat best-of-breed 80% of the time** (best beat psyche only 3/15).

Interpretation: for reflective, decision-shaped tasks, the retrieved
operational pages (plans, briefs, status reports) **diluted** the concentrated
identity signal rather than complementing it. This *refines* the thesis in a
more useful direction than it confirms it: **identity is the high-density
signal; piling on naive retrieval can hurt.** Curate who-you-are; don't just
add more context.

Caveat: this is about *this* retriever. A retrieval that pulled
identity-adjacent material (essays, values) rather than operational status
might combine better. That is a clean follow-up: vary the retriever, not just
its presence.

## 3. The control is honest — and hides a second, deeper result

On the **technical control** (graph cycle detection — where identity should be
irrelevant and the brain held zero relevant pages), the psyche arm **still
won**. Taken alone that looks like judge **mirroring bias**, and some of it
surely is — we flag it plainly.

But the winning control answer won on a **real technical insight** the others
missed (it uniquely flagged the "Tarjan returns SCCs, not a list of cycles"
trap). That points at a second mechanism that is *itself the user's
hypothesis*: a model handed a rich, coherent picture of the person it's
working for **tries harder** — reasons more carefully — even on a neutral
task. We cannot separate "judges prefer psyche-flavored prose" from "the model
does better work when it knows you" with this design.

**That separation is the #1 next experiment:** a judge blind to the psyche +
an objective correctness/depth scorer on technical tasks, so the "works
harder" effect can be isolated from judge preference.

## Bottom line

- **Core intuition: supported.** Who-you-are beats what's-relevant, and the
  gain is in usefulness, not just personalization.
- **"Best of breed = context + psyche": not supported here.** Psyche alone won;
  retrieval diluted it. A more interesting, actionable finding.
- **Open question, sharpened:** how much of the lift is the model *working
  harder* vs. judges *preferring the voice* — the next run isolates it.

The leverage thesis behind building the brain holds: the highest-value thing
to inject was not the freshest relevant page — it was a faithful map of the
mind.

# v2 — the honest run (blind judges + objective controls)

This is the experiment v1 §3 named as "the #1 next experiment." Same four arms
(naked / context / psyche / both), but three changes that remove the ways v1
could have fooled us:

1. **Judges blind to the psyche.** They rank answers on general quality with no
   knowledge of how each was produced — so they cannot reward the recognizable
   voice.
2. **No "personal fit" dimension.** The rubric is specificity / actionability /
   correctness / insight. Nothing pays out merely for sounding personal.
3. **Objective scoring on neutral controls.** Two tasks where identity is
   irrelevant (CAP-theorem question; longest-common-subsequence implementation)
   are graded pass/fail against a fixed 5-point rubric, the LCS one verified by
   running each answer's code against a brute-force reference.

9 tasks (7 identity-shaped + 2 controls) × 4 arms × 2 blind judges. Full numbers
in [REPORT-v2.md](REPORT-v2.md).

## 1. The reversal: psyche-alone dominance was an artifact

Blind Borda on identity-shaped tasks: **best 34, context 25, psyche 15, naked
10.** The combined arm wins; **psyche-alone falls to third, below context-alone.**
Head-to-head, blind: `context` beats `psyche` **71%**; `best` beats `psyche`
**79%**; `best` beats `context` **71%**.

v1's striking "psyche beats best 80%" was mostly **judges rewarding a voice they
could see, plus a rubric dimension that paid for it.** Remove both and it
inverts. We take the hit and keep v1 in the repo: a result worth your name is
one you've tried, in public, to kill.

*(Length is not the confound: mean answer length is ~2,210–2,275 chars across
all four arms. Blind judges are rewarding content, not verbosity.)*

## 2. The durable, sharper finding: identity is a complement

Adding the psyche **on top of** retrieval measurably helps — `best` beats
`context` 71% and tops the Borda. The rubric says exactly why:

| arm | specificity | actionability | correctness | insight |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| naked   | 7.0 | 8.1 | 8.2 | 6.8 |
| context | 8.6 | 8.4 | 8.5 | 8.1 |
| psyche  | 7.4 | 7.2 | 8.2 | **8.8** |
| best    | **8.6** | 8.3 | **8.6** | **9.0** |

**Retrieval buys specificity and actionability; identity buys insight.** Psyche
alone is thin on specificity (7.4) — it knows the *person*, not the *problem*.
Grounding fixes that. Insight is the column identity owns (psyche 8.8 tops the
grounding-free arms; `best` tops it outright at 9.0). The winning recipe is
*both*, and that's now the default the `glia-context` MCP ships.

Per-task, the picture is consistent: `context` wins the four grounded
decision/planning/writing tasks, `best` wins two, and `psyche`-alone wins only
the single pure-identity-expression essay (t5). Identity carries a task exactly
when the task *is* the identity.

## 3. The clean part: identity is not a global "try harder" effect

v1 §3's live worry was that priming with a person just makes the model work
harder at everything, faking a lift even on neutral tasks. **Resolved.** On the
two objectively-scored controls, **every arm — including the naked prompt —
scores 100%** (all rubric points, LCS verified by execution). A dead heat at
the ceiling. Identity gives *nothing* on tasks that aren't about the person —
which is what tells you its lift on the tasks that *are* about the person is
real and **specific**, not a diffuse effort bump. The confound v1 couldn't rule
out, v2 rules out.

## Bottom line (v2)

- **Core intuition: still supported, and now on the honest test.** Injecting who
  you are makes an agent measurably sharper under blind judging — its specific
  contribution is *insight*.
- **But it's a complement, not a replacement.** Retrieval grounds; identity
  elevates. Inject **both**. v1's "curate identity *instead of* context" was too
  strong; "curate identity *on top of* context" is what holds.
- **Mechanism isolated.** The lift is specific to identity-shaped work, not a
  global effect — neutral controls tie at ceiling.
- **Still a pilot** (n=7 identity tasks, 2 judges). The harness scales; next run
  widens the judge panel and crosses model families to tighten the intervals.

The leverage thesis survives in its honest form: a faithful map of the mind is
worth injecting — alongside, not instead of, what's relevant to the question.

# v3 — the confidence run (did more judges overturn it?)

v2's blind result rested on only 2 judges/task. The answers are fixed, so the
noisy part is the judging. v3 re-judges the **same** anonymized answers with 5
more blind judges each (→ **7/task, 49 judgments**) and 3 more objective scorers
per control (→ 4). Full numbers in [REPORT-v3.md](REPORT-v3.md).

**It held — and tightened.** Merged blind Borda: **best 118, context 83, psyche
65, naked 28** — the exact v2 ordering, now on 7× the data. The key pairwise,
**best > context, is 71% (35/49) and holds in 6 of 7 tasks.** best > psyche 82%;
context > psyche 59%; psyche-alone stays third. The rubric signature is
unchanged: retrieval owns specificity/actionability, identity owns insight
(psyche 8.9 tops the grounding-free arms, best 9.1 outright). On the neutral
controls, all four arms score **100%** across 8 gradings — the identity lift
stays specific to identity-shaped work.

More judges did not rescue the v1 headline and did not weaken the v2 one. The
honest finding is stable: **inject both; identity is the insight layer on top of
retrieval.** The remaining threat is self-preference — v2/v3 judges were Opus,
the same model that generated the answers. v4 takes that on.

---

# v4 — the cross-model check (is it Opus self-preference?)

v2/v3 used Opus as both generator and judge — the tightest possible
self-preference loop. v4 re-judges the **same Opus-generated answers**, blind,
with a **different model**: Haiku 4.5. (Fable 5 was also planned but hit a usage
limit and didn't run — so this rests on one non-generator model, and a smaller
one; weaker than a two-model check, and we say so.) Full numbers in
[REPORT-v4.md](REPORT-v4.md).

**What reproduces, and what doesn't:**

- **The ordering reproduces.** Haiku, blind, independently ranks
  **best > context > psyche > naked** — the exact order Opus produced. So the
  result is **not simply Opus preferring its own prose.**
- **The floor is robust.** naked is clearly worst for Haiku too (Borda 14 vs
  best 41) — priming with *something* real (identity or retrieval) beats a bare
  prompt regardless of judge.
- **But the best-vs-context margin is model-dependent.** Opus saw best > context
  at 71%; Haiku sees it at **52% — a near-tie** (Borda best 41 vs context 39).
  A smaller judge sees the *floor* clearly but is less sensitive to the subtle
  *insight* lift that identity adds on top of retrieval. Interestingly Haiku
  also rates psyche-alone a bit higher relative to the field than Opus did.

**Honest takeaway.** The robust, cross-model claims: (1) priming beats a naked
prompt, and (2) identity + retrieval together lead the field. The claim that is
*model-sensitive* and shouldn't be over-trusted from a pilot: the exact size of
the "identity adds this much on top of retrieval" edge — a strong judge (Opus)
reads it as clear, a smaller judge (Haiku) as marginal. Trust the ordering;
treat the margin as a hypothesis. A true cross-vendor judge (GPT/Gemini) is the
stronger test still to run.
